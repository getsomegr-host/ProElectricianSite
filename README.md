# ProElectricianSite

A small demo/resume website for electrician services built as a portfolio project.

Demo: https://proelectriciannow.com/RepoTest/

## Quick start

- Open `index.html` in a web browser for the static demo.
- To enable the PHP contact form (contact.php), run a local PHP server from the project root:

  php -S localhost:8000

  Then visit: http://localhost:8000/

- Alternatively for a static-only preview (no PHP):

  python -m http.server 8000

  and visit: http://localhost:8000/

## Usage

Edit `index.html`, files under `js/`, `scripts/`, and `images/` to customize the site content and assets.

## Notes

- Contact form (contact.php) requires a working PHP environment and server-side mail configuration; do not expose credentials in the repo.
